# Amber Jamison

## About Me
I am a Computer Science student with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at Alabama A&M University, graduating in May 2026. I am also a Division I student-athlete, which has helped me develop strong time management skills, discipline, and the ability to learn and perform in high-pressure environments.

I am building my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and software development through coursework, projects, and hands-on learning experiences. I have worked with data analysis, visualization, and introductory machine learning concepts, and I am interested in applying these tools to solve real-world problems in a practical and thoughtful way.

My interests include:
- Data Analytics and Visualization  
- Machine Learning and Applied AI  
- Software Engineering  
- Data-driven problem solving and decision support
